Google Play Store Data Analysis

Oasis Infobyte Internship — Level 2 Project 2

Project Overview
In this project, I performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Google Play Store data to explore app categories, ratings, pricing, installs, and user sentiments using Python libraries. The goal was to extract useful insights and trends from the dataset.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Plotly for interactive graphs
TextBlob for sentiment analysis

Dataset Information
apps.csv — Contains app details like category, rating, reviews, installs, price, size, etc.
user_reviews.csv — Contains user reviews with translated text and sentiment scores.
The dataset files are included inside the Dataset folder.

Conclusion
This project helped in understanding the Google Play Store market using real-world data. It improved my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and basic natural language processing with sentiment analysis. The final outcome shows clear trends on which app types perform well in terms of ratings, installs, and user satisfaction.
